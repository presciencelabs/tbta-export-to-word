Kajadian  -  Genesis


Genesis 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Genesis 1:1 Pamugaan, Allah manjadiakan langit wan bumi.

Genesis 1:2 The earth was formless and empty. Darkness was covering the deep water. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the water.
Genesis 1:2 Bumi baluman bapotongan wan puang. Manukupi banyu nang dalam. Lalu Ruh Kudus Allah malayang-layang atas banyu.

Genesis 1:3 Then God said, “Let there be light.” Then there was light.
Genesis 1:3 Lalu Allah baucap, “Baadalah cahaya.” Lalu ada cahaya.

Genesis 1:4 God looked at the light and knew that it was good. Then he separated the light from the darkness.
Genesis 1:4 Allah malihat cahaya wan tahu bahawa itu bagus. Lalu cahaya dipisahakanNya matan.

Genesis 1:5 God called the light 'day' and called the darkness 'night'. Literal Alternate: That evening and that morning were the first day. Dynamic Alternate: God did these things on the first day.
Genesis 1:5 Allah manyambat cahaya 'hari' lalu disambatNya 'malam'.

Genesis 1:6 Then God said, “Let there be a vault that will be between the water. That vault will separate the water that is below it from the water that is above it.”
Genesis 1:6 Lalu Allah baucap, “Baadalah kubah di tangah banyu. Kubah nang itu cagar mamisahakan banyu di bawah itu matan banyu nang baada di atas itu.”

Genesis 1:7 And so God made a vault and separated the water that was below it from the water that was above it. And it was so.
Genesis 1:7 Maka Allah maulah kubah lalu banyu di bawah itu dipisahakanNya matan banyu nang baada di atas itu.

Genesis 1:8 God called that vault 'sky'. Literal Alternate: That evening and that morning were the second day. Dynamic Alternate: God did these things on the second day.
Genesis 1:8 Allah manyambat kubah nang itu 'langit'. (Literal alternate:) Malam nang itu, wan baisukan nang itu hari nang kadua. (Dynamic alternate:) Allah malakuakan nang ini pada hari nang kadua.

Genesis 1:9 Then God said, “Let the water that is under the sky be gathered. And let dry ground appear.” And it was so.
Genesis 1:9 

Genesis 1:10 God called the dry ground 'land' and called the water that he had gathered 'seas'. He looked at the land and the seas and knew that they were good.
Genesis 1:10 

Genesis 1:11 Then God said, “Let the earth produce plants. And those plants will produce seeds. And trees will produce fruit that contains seeds. Each seed will produce a plant. And that plant will be the same kind of plant that produced the seed.” And it was so.
Genesis 1:11 

Genesis 1:12 So the earth started producing plants. Each plant produced seeds. And each seed produced a plant. And that plant was the same kind of plant that had produced the seed. And trees produced fruit that contained seeds. Each seed produced a tree. And that tree was the same kind of tree that had produced the seed. God looked at those plants and knew that they were good.
Genesis 1:12

Genesis 1:14 

Genesis 1:15 Let these lights that are in the heavens shine on the earth.” And it was so.
Genesis 1:15 

Genesis 1:16 God made two great lights. He made a bright light that shines during the day. And he made a small light that shines during the night. And he also made the stars.
Genesis 1:16 

Genesis 1:17 God put all of these lights in the heavens to shine on the earth.
Genesis 1:17 

Genesis 1:18 These lights shine during the day and during the night and separate the light from the darkness. God saw these lights. And these lights were good.
Genesis 1:18 

Genesis 1:19 Literal Alternate: That evening and that morning were the fourth day. Dynamic Alternate: God did these things on the fourth day.
Genesis 1:19 

Genesis 1:20 Then God said, “Let many fish and many animals live in the water. And let many birds fly in the sky above the earth.”
Genesis 1:20 

Genesis 1:21 And so God created the big animals that were living in the ocean. And he created all of the living things that were moving in the ocean. He created all of the kinds of the living things that were in the ocean. And he also created all of the birds. He created all of the kinds of birds. He saw all of these animals. And these animals were good.
Genesis 1:21 

Genesis 1:22 Then God blessed those animals and said to them, “Be fruitful. And multiply. Let there be many fish in the water. And let there be many birds in the air.”
Genesis 1:22 

Genesis 1:23 Literal Alternate: That evening and that morning were the fifth day. Dynamic Alternate: God did these things on the fifth day.
Genesis 1:23 

Genesis 1:24 Then God said, Literal Alternate: “Let the land produce living animals, Dynamic Alternate: “Let different kinds of animals appear on the land End of Alternates.

Genesis 1:24 

Genesis 1:25 God made all of the wild animals, all of the livestock, and all of the animals that crawled on the ground. Those animals always gave birth to babies that were the same kind of animal. God saw all of those animals and knew that they were good.
Genesis 1:25 

Genesis 1:26 Then God said, “Let's create people now. Those people will have our image. They'll rule the fish that are in the ocean and the birds that are in the sky. They'll rule the livestock, the wild animals, and the animals that crawl on the ground.”
Genesis 1:26 

Genesis 1:27 And so God created people. Those people had God's image. God created those people. And those people had God's image. God created one man and one woman.
Genesis 1:27 

Genesis 1:28 Then God blessed those people and said to them, “Be fruitful. And multiply. Rule all of the things that are on the earth. Rule the fish that are in the ocean and the birds that are in the sky. Rule all of the animals that move on the ground.”
Genesis 1:28 

Genesis 1:29 Then God said to those people, “I'm giving you all of the plants that produce seeds on the earth and all of the trees that produce fruit that contains seeds. You may eat those plants and that fruit.
Genesis 1:29 

Genesis 1:30 And I created all of the green plants for all of the big animals, all of the birds that are in the sky, and all of the animals that move on the ground. All of the living animals will eat the green plants.” And it was so.

Genesis 1:31 


Title: God rests on the seventh day.
Genesis 2:1 So the heavens, the earth, and all of the things that were in them were created.
Title: Allah baistirehat pada hari nang katujuh.
Genesis 2:1 Maka langit, bumi, wan samuaan banda-banda di dalam itu tuntung dijadiakan.

Genesis 2:2 God finished working on the sixth day. So on the seventh day he rested.
Genesis 2:2 Allah tuntung bagawi pada hari nang kaanam. Maka hari nang katujuh, Inya baistirehat.

Genesis 2:3 Then God blessed the seventh day. He caused the seventh day to be holy because he rested on it. He didn't work on the seventh day.
Genesis 2:3 Lalu Allah mambarakahi hari nang katujuh. DiulahNya hari nang katujuh suci lantaran Inya baistirehat pada hari nang katujuh. Inya kada bagawi pada hari nang katujuh.

Genesis 2:4 And so the LORD God created all of the things that were in the heavens and all of the things that were on the earth. God made the earth and the heavens.
Genesis 2:4 Maka Allah Al Khalik manjadiakan samuaan banda-banda di dalam langit wan samuaan banda-banda nang baada di bumi. Bumi wan langit dijadiakanNya.

Title: Adam and Eve live in Eden.
Genesis 2:5 In those days plants weren't growing on the earth. The LORD God didn't yet cause it to rain. And God didn't create yet people who will take care of the plants.
Title: Adam wan Hawa bagana di Eden.
Genesis 2:5 Pada jaman nang itu tanaman-tanaman kada tumbuh di bumi. Allah Al Khalik kada manurun hujan. Lalu Inya kada manjadiakan urang-urang nang cagar maharagu tanaman-tanaman.

Genesis 2:6 But water came from the ground. It flowed to all of the places that were on the earth.
Genesis 2:6 Tagal banyu kaluar matan tanah. Itu maaliri samuaan daerah-daerah di bumi.

Genesis 2:7 Then the LORD God created a man and used the dust that was on the ground to make his body. Then God breathed into that man's nose. And so he caused that man to become alive.
Genesis 2:7 Lalu Allah Al Khalik manjadiakan manusia lalu manggunaakan dabu di atas tanah handak maulah awaknya. Lalu Inya hidung urang nang itu. Maka diulahNya urang nang itu hidup.

Genesis 2:8 God made a garden that was in the eastern region. The name of that garden was Eden. God put the man that he created in that garden.
Genesis 2:8 Allah maulah kabun di daerah timur. Ngaran kabun nang itu adalah Eden. Allah mambuati di kabun nang itu urang nang dijadiakan ulih Inya.

Genesis 2:9 The LORD God caused many beautiful trees and many trees that produced good fruit to grow in that garden. God also put two special trees in the middle of that garden. The fruit that is on one of those trees causes people to live forever. And the fruit that is on the other tree causes people to know about good things and evil things.
Genesis 2:9 Allah Al Khalik maulah banyak puhun nang rindang wan banyak puhun nang mahasilakan bubuahan nang nyaman dimakan tumbuh di kabun nang itu. Inya jua manumbuhakan dua rapun puhun nang istimewah di tangah-tangah kabun nang itu. Buah di salah sarapun puhun nang itu maulah urang-urang hidup salawasan. Lalu buah di puhun nang lain maulah urang-urang tahu lawan napa-napa nang baik wan napa-napa nang jahat.

Genesis 2:10 There was a river in Eden. It carried water to all of the plants that were in that garden. After that river flowed through Eden, that river divided into four rivers.
Genesis 2:10 Ada sabuah sungai nang di Eden. Itu maaliri banyu ka samuaan tanaman-tanaman di kabun nang itu. Imbah itu maalir malalui Eden, hanyar itu tabagi manjadi ampat buah sungai.

Genesis 2:11 The name of the first river is Pishon. That river flows through Havilah. There is gold in Havilah.
Genesis 2:11 Ngaran sungai nang panambaian adalah Pison. Sungai nang itu maalir malalui Hawila. Ada amas di Hawila.

Genesis 2:12 (The gold that is in that land is good. Perfume and onyx also are in Havilah.)
Genesis 2:12 (Amas di banua nang itu bagus. Minyak harum wan batu krisopras baada di Hawila jua.)

Genesis 2:13 The name of the second river is Gihon. That river flows through Cush.
Genesis 2:13 Ngaran sungai nang kadua adalah Gihon. Sungai nang itu maalir malalui Kush.

Genesis 2:14 The name of the third river is Tigris. That river flows along the eastern border of Assyria. And the name of the fourth river is Euphrates.
Genesis 2:14 Ngaran sungai nang katalu adalah Tigris. Sungai nang itu maalir di subalah tambit timur Asyur. Wan ngaran sungai nang kaampat adalah Efrat.

Genesis 2:15 So <<after the LORD God created that man,>> he put that man in the garden of Eden to take care of the plants.
Genesis 2:15 Maka <<imbah Allah Al Khalik manjadiakan manusia nang itu,>> hanyar Inya mambuati urang nang itu di kabun nang bangaran Eden gasan maharagu tanaman-tanaman.

Genesis 2:16 Then the LORD God said to that man, “You may eat the fruit that is on all of the trees that are in this garden.
Genesis 2:16 Lalu Allah Al Khalik baucap lawan urang nang itu, “Ikam kawa mamakan bubuahan di samuaan pupuhunan di kabun nang ini <<kacuali buah nang baada di sarapun puhun>>.

Genesis 2:17 But you must not eat the fruit that causes you to know about good things and evil things. If you eat that fruit, you'll certainly die.”
Genesis 2:17 Tagal ikam musti kada bulih mamakan bubuahan nang maulah ikam tahu lawan napa-napa nang baik wan napa-napa nang jahat. Amun ikam mamakan buah nang itu, ikam musti mati.”

Title: God creates the first woman.
Genesis 2:18 Then the LORD God said, “It isn't good that this man is alone. I'll make a companion who will help this man.”
Title: Allah manjadiakan bibinian nang panambaian.
Genesis 2:18 Lalu Allah Al Khalik baucap, “Kada baik urang nang ini saurangan haja. Aku handak maulah pasangan nang cagar mambantu urang nang ini.”

Genesis 2:19 God had already created all of the animals and the birds from the dust that was on the ground. So he brought all of those animals and all of those birds to that man so that he could name them. Then that man named all of the living animals and all of the birds <<that God brought to him>>.
Genesis 2:19 Allah sudah manjadiakan samuaan hewan-hewan wan burung-burung matan dabu di atas tanah. Maka dibawaNya samuaan hewan-hewan nang itu wan samuaan burung-burung nang itu ka urang nang itu sakira inya kawa mangarani bubuhannya. Lalu urang nang itu mangarani samuaan hewan-hewan nang hidup wan samuaan burung-burung <<nang dibawa ka inya ulih Allah>>.

Genesis 2:20 So that man named the livestock, the birds that were in the sky, and the wild animals. <<God called that man 'Adam'.>> But Adam didn't see an animal that was able to help him. Footnote: 'Adam' means 'man'.
Genesis 2:20 Maka urang nang itu mangarani binatang-binatang, wan hewan-hewan nang liar burung-burung di langit. <<Allah mangarani urang nang itu 'Adam'.>> Tagal Adam kada malihat hewan nang bisa mambantunya. 
Footnote: 'Adam' baarti 'urang'.

Genesis 2:21 So the LORD God caused Adam to sleep deeply. While Adam was sleeping, God took one rib out of his body. Then he healed Adam's skin.
Genesis 2:21 Maka Allah Al Khalik maulah Adam guring janak. Wayah Adam guring, Inya mancabut sabilah tulang rusuk di awaknya. Lalu kulimbit Adam diwarasakanNya.

Genesis 2:22 Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib that he took out of the man. And God brought that woman to that man.
Genesis 2:22 Lalu Allah Al Khalik maulah bibinian matan tulang rusuk nang dicabut di urang ulih Inya lalu inya dibawaNya ka urang nang itu.

Genesis 2:23 <<After Adam saw that woman,>> he said, “God made this person from one of my bones and made her flesh from my flesh! I'll call this person 'woman' because God made this person from a man.”
Genesis 2:23 <<Imbah Adam malihat bibinian nang itu,>> hanyar inya baucap, “Allah maulah bibinian nang ini matan salah satulangku! Lalu Inya maulah daging bibinian nang ini matan dagingku! Aku handak manyambat bibinian nang ini 'bibinian' lantaran Inya maulah bibinian nang ini matan urang.”

Genesis 2:24 Therefore, a man leaves his father and his mother to marry a woman. God joins the woman to the man so that they could become one body.
Genesis 2:24 Maka ada saikung urang nang maninggalakan abahnya wan umanya handak mangawini bibinian. Allah manyatuakan urang wan bibinian sakira bubuhannya kawa manjadi saawak.

Genesis 2:25 Adam and his wife were naked. But they weren't ashamed.
Genesis 2:25 Adam wan bininya batilanjang bulat. Tagal bubuhannya kada marasa supan.


Title: Adam and Eve sin.
Genesis 3:1 The snake was the most clever wild animal that the LORD God created. One day the snake asked the woman, “Did God say to you, ‘You must not eat the fruit of the trees that are in this garden?’”
Title: Adam wan Hawa badosa.
Genesis 3:1 Ular adalah hewan nang paliciknya nang liar nang dijadiakan ulih Allah Al Khalik. Wayah itu, inya batakun lawan bibinian, “Bujuranlah Allah baucap lawan bubuhan ikam, ‘Bubuhan ikam musti kada bulih mamakan buah pupuhunan nang baada di kabun nang ini’?”

Genesis 3:2 That woman answered the snake, “God allows us to eat the fruit of all of these trees that are in this garden.
Genesis 3:2 Bibinian nang itu mamadahakan lawan ular, “Allah maijinakan kami mamakan buah samuaan pupuhunan nang baada di kabun nang ini.

Genesis 3:3 But God said to us, ‘You must not eat the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden. And you must not touch that tree's fruit. If you touch that tree's fruit, you'll die.’”
Genesis 3:3 Tagal Allah baucap lawan kami, ‘Bubuhan ikam musti kada bulih mamakan buah puhun nang baada di tangah-tangah kabun. Lalu bubuhan ikam musti kada bulih manjapay buah puhun nang itu. Amun bubuhan ikam manjapay buah puhun nang itu, bubuhan ikam matian.’”

Genesis 3:4 But the snake said to that woman, “You certainly won't die!
Genesis 3:4 Tagal ular baucap lawan bibinian nang itu, “Bubuhan ikam kada cagaran matian!

Genesis 3:5 God knows that after you eat that fruit, you'll become like him! If you eat that fruit, you'll know whether something is good or something is evil. <<But God doesn't want you to become like him.”>>
Genesis 3:5 Allah tahu bahawa imbah bubuhan ikam kaina mamakan buah nang itu, hanyar bubuhan ikam kaina manjadi nang kaya Inya! Amun bubuhan ikam mamakan buah nang itu, bubuhan ikam tahu apakah sanapa baik atawa apakah sanapa jahat. <<Tagal Allah kada handak bubuhan ikam manjadi nang kaya Inya.”>>

Genesis 3:6 Then the woman looked at the fruit that was on that tree. She thought that that fruit will taste very good. And that fruit was very beautiful. And the woman thought that that fruit will cause her to become wise. So she picked that tree's fruit and ate it. And she gave some fruit to her husband, who was with her. And the man also ate that fruit.
Genesis 3:6 Lalu bibinian malihat buah di puhun nang itu. Bapikirnya buah nang itu cagar marasa bagus banar. Wan buah nang itu bungas banar. Wan bibinian bapikir itu cagar maulah inya manjadi bailmu. Maka inya mamutik buah puhun nang itu lalu itu dimakan ulih bibinian. Lalu dibarinya buah ka lakinya, nang baada lawan bibinian. Lalu urang mamakan buah nang itu jua.

Genesis 3:7 Then that man and that woman realized immediately that they were naked. <<And they were ashamed.>> So they made clothes with some leaves of a fig tree and covered their bodies with them.
Genesis 3:7 Lalu urang wan bibinian nang itu langsung manyadari bahawa bubuhannya batilanjang bulat. <<Lalu bubuhannya marasa supan.>> Maka bubuhannya maulah baju pakai daun puhun buah ara lalu awaknya ditutupinya lawan itu.

Genesis 3:8 During the cool time of the day that man and his wife heard the LORD God walking in the garden. They hid from the LORD God behind some trees that were in the garden. <<They hid from the LORD God because they were ashamed.>>
Genesis 3:8 Wayah waktu hari naung, urang nang itu wan bininya mandangarakan Allah Al Khalik bajalan di kabun. Bubuhannya basambunyian matan Allah Al Khalik di balakang pupuhunan di kabun. <<Bubuhannya basambunyian matan Allah Al Khalik lantaran bubuhannya marasa supan.>>

Genesis 3:9 But the LORD God called that man. And God asked, “Where are you?”
Genesis 3:9 Tagal Allah Al Khalik mangiau urang nang itu lalu batakun, “Di mana garang ikam?”

Genesis 3:10 The man answered the LORD God, “I heard you in the garden and was afraid because I'm naked. So I hid from you.”
Genesis 3:10 Urang manyahuti Allah Al Khalik, “Aku mandangar Pian di kabun. Wan aku takutan lantaran aku batilanjang bulat. Maka aku basambunyi matan Pian.”

Genesis 3:11 The LORD God asked that man, “Who told you that you're naked? Did you eat the fruit that I forbade you to eat?”
Genesis 3:11 Allah Al Khalik batakun lawan urang nang itu, “Siapa mamadahakan lawan ikam bahwa ikam batilanjang bulat? Bujuranlah ikam mamakan buah nang ikam ditangati ulih Aku ikam mamakan?”

Genesis 3:12 Then the man said, “The woman that you gave to me gave me the fruit that she picked from that tree! And I ate that fruit.”
Genesis 3:12 Lalu urang baucap, “Bibinian nang dibari ka aku ulih Pian mambari ka aku buah nang diputik di puhun nang itu ulih inya! Lalu aku mamakan buah nang itu.”

Genesis 3:13 Then the LORD God asked that woman, “What did you do?” That woman answered, “The snake tricked me! So I ate the fruit.”
Genesis 3:13 Lalu Allah Al Khalik batakun lawan bibinian nang itu, “Napa nang ikam lakuakan?” Bibinian nang itu mamadahakan, “Ular mambunguli aku! Maka aku mamakan buah.”

Genesis 3:14 Then the LORD God said to that snake, “I curse you because you tricked this woman. I'll cause you to become different from all of the other animals. You won't be like the livestock or the wild animals. You'll crawl on the ground and eat dust until you die.
Genesis 3:14 Lalu Allah Al Khalik baucap lawan ular nang itu, “Aku mangutuk ikam lantaran ikam mambunguli bibinian nang ini. Aku handak maulah ikam manjadi balainan lawan samuaan hewan-hewan nang lain. Ikam kada cagar manyamai lawan binatang atawa hewan-hewan nang liar. Ikam kaina bakurayap di atas tanah lalu mamakan dabu sampai ikam hanyar mati.

Genesis 3:15 I'll cause you and the woman to become enemies. And your descendants and the woman's descendants will become enemies. The woman's descendant will crush your head. And you'll bite the woman's descendant's heel.” Footnote: After Adam and Eve sinned in the garden of Eden, God told them about his plan. The woman's descendant is Jesus, who is God's son. God sent his son to the earth so that he could die for us. When the soldiers crucified Jesus, Satan bit Jesus' heel. But Jesus rose from the dead. When Jesus throws Satan into hell, he'll crush Satan's head. Satan will suffer in hell forever because he didn't obey God. Although Adam and Eve didn't obey God, he forgave them so that they could live in heaven with him forever.
Genesis 3:15 Aku handak maulah ikam wan bibinian bamusuhan. Lalu juriat ikam wan juriat bibinian cagar bamusuhan. Ada saurang juriat bibinian nang cagar maramukakan kapala ikam. Lalu ikam kaina mamatuk tumit juriat bibinian.”

Genesis 3:16 And the LORD God said to that woman, “I'll cause you to hurt severely while you give birth to your children. You'll desire your husband. But your husband will rule you.”
Genesis 3:16 Wan Allah Al Khalik baucap lawan bibinian nang itu, “Aku handak maulah ikam sakit banar wayah ikam maranakakan anak-anak ikam. Ikam kaina mainginakan laki ikam. Tagal laki ikam cagar bakuasa ikam.”

Genesis 3:17 Then the LORD God said to Adam, “I'll curse the ground because you listened to your wife and because you ate the fruit that I forbade you to eat. You'll work hard while you're alive to obtain food.
Genesis 3:17 Lalu Allah Al Khalik baucap lawan Adam, “Aku handak mangutuk tanah lantaran ikam mandangarakan pandiran bini ikam wan lantaran ikam mamakan buah nang ikam ditangati ulih Aku ikam mamakan. Saumuran, ikam kaina bagawi barat handak mancari'i makanan.

Genesis 3:18 Many thorns and many weeds will grow in the field. And you'll eat the plants that will grow in the field.
Genesis 3:18 Banyak kumpai baduri wan banyak rukam cagar tumbuh di padang. Lalu ikam kaina mamakan tanaman-tanaman nang cagar tumbuh di padang.

Genesis 3:19 When you work in the field, you'll sweat. And you'll work hard until you die to obtain food. Then after you die, you'll return to the ground. I made you with dust. And after you die, you'll become dust again.”
Genesis 3:19 Ikam kaina bapaluh leher. Bilanya ikam bagawi di padang lalu ikam kaina bagawi barat sampai ikam hanyar mati handak mancari'i makanan. Imbah itu imbah ikam kaina mati, hanyar ikam kaina bulik ka tanah. Aku maulah ikam pakai dabu. Wan imbah ikam kaina mati, hanyar ikam kaina manjadi pulang dabu.”

Genesis 3:20 Adam named his wife Eve because she is the mother of all of the people who will live on the earth. Footnote: The word 'Eve' sounds like 'live' in Hebrew.
Genesis 3:20 Adam mangarani bininya Hawa lantaran inya adalah umanya sabarataan urang-urang nang cagar hidup di atas bumi. 
Footnote: Kata 'Hawa' dalam bahasa Ibrani tadangar nang kaya kata 'hidup'.

Genesis 3:21 Then the LORD God made clothes for Adam and Eve with animals' skin. And God covered Adam and Eve with those clothes.
Genesis 3:21 Lalu Allah Al Khalik maulah baju pakai kulimbit hewan-hewan gasan Adam wan Hawa lalu bubuhannya dilapis lawan itu ulih Allah.

Genesis 3:22 Then the LORD God said, “This man has become like one of us. The man knows whether something is good or something is evil. We have to prevent the man from eating the fruit that causes people to live forever. If the man eats that fruit, he'll live forever.”
Genesis 3:22 Lalu Allah Al Khalik baucap, “Urang nang ini sudah manjadi nang kaya Kita. Inya tahu apakah sanapa baik atawa apakah sanapa jahat. Kita musti manangati inya cagar mamakan buah nang maulah urang-urang hidup salawasan. Amun urang mamakan buah nang itu, inya hidup salawasan.”

Genesis 3:23 So the LORD God forced that man and that woman to leave the garden of Eden. Then that man that God created from dust started working on the soil.
Genesis 3:23 Maka Allah Al Khalik mamaksa urang wan bibinian nang itu maninggalakan kabun nang bangaran Eden. Lalu urang nang dijadiakan matan dabu ulih Allah bamula bagawi di atas tanah.

Genesis 3:24 After the LORD God forced that man to leave the garden of Eden, he sent cherubim to the eastern side of the garden of Eden <<to prevent that man from returning to the garden>>. God gave those cherubim a sword that was made of fire. Those cherubim guarded the path that led to the tree that had fruit that causes people to live forever. <<After that day God didn't allow people to enter that garden again.>>
Genesis 3:24 Imbah Allah Al Khalik mamaksa urang nang itu maninggalakan kabun nang bangaran Eden, hanyar Inya mautus malaikat-malaikat ka pinggir timurnya <<gasan manangati inya cagar bulik ka situ>>. DibariNya pedang nang banyala-nyala ka malaikat-malaikat nang itu. Malaikat-malaikat nang itu manjaga jalan nang baampah ka puhun nang baisi buah nang maulah urang-urang hidup salawasan. <<Imbah hari itu jua, hanyar Allah kada maijinakan urang-urang mamasuki pulang ka kabun nang itu.>>


Title: Cain kills Abel.
Genesis 4:1 Adam slept with his wife named Eve. Then Eve became pregnant and gave birth to a son named Cain. Then she said, “The LORD helped me give birth to this child.” Footnote: The word 'Cain' sounds like 'get' in Hebrew.
Title: Kabil mamati'i Habil.
Genesis 4:1 Adam mangumpuli bininya nang bangaran Hawa. Lalu Hawa batianan wan diranakakannya saikung anak lalakian nang bangaran Kabil. Lalu inya baucap, “Allah manulungi aku maranakakan anak nang ini.” 
Footnote: Kata 'Kabil' dalam bahasa Ibrani tadangar nang kaya kata 'diambil'.

Genesis 4:2 Later Eve gave birth to another son named Abel. <<When Abel grew up,>> he was a shepherd. And <<when Cain grew up,>> he grew crops.
Genesis 4:2 Imbah itu, Hawa maranakakan saikung anak lalakian nang lain nang bangaran Habil. <<Wayah Habil sudah tuha,>> inya maharagu kambing-kambing biri-biri. Lalu <<wayah Kabil sudah tuha,>> inya mananam jalai.

Genesis 4:3 One day Cain brought an offering to the LORD. Cain's offering was fruit that he harvested.
Genesis 4:3 Wayah itu, Kabil mambawa parsambahan ka Allah. Parsambahan Kabil adalah bubuahan nang dikatam ulih inya.

Genesis 4:4 And Abel also brought an offering to the LORD. Abel killed several of his firstborn sheep. Then he cut those sheep's best parts off and brought them to the LORD. The LORD was pleased with Abel and accepted his offering.
Genesis 4:4 Wan Habil jua mambawa parsambahan ka Allah. Dimati'inya babarapa kambing-kambing biri-biri Habil nang panuhannya. Lalu ditataknya bahagian-bahagian kambing-kambing biri-biri nang itu nang pambagusnya-pambagusnya lalu itu dibawanya ka Allah. Allah sanang lawan Habil wan parsambahannya ditarimaNya.

Genesis 4:5 But the LORD wasn't pleased with Cain and didn't accept his offering. So Cain became very angry and looked very upset.
Genesis 4:5 Tagal Allah kada sanang lawan Kabil wan parsambahannya kada ditarimaNya. Maka Kabil sarik banar wan pina sarik banar.

Genesis 4:6 Then the LORD asked Cain, “Why are you angry? Why do you look upset?
Genesis 4:6 Lalu Allah batakun lawan Kabil, “Kanapa maka ikam sarik? Kanapa maka ikam pina sarik?

Genesis 4:7 If you obey me, I'll be pleased with you. But if you don't obey me, sin is like a wild animal that will attack you. It desires to destroy you. But you have to fight sin.”

Genesis 4:8 Then Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let's go to the field.” <<So Cain and Abel went to the field.>> Cain attacked his brother while he and Abel were in that field. And Cain killed his brother.
Genesis 4:8 Imbah itu Kabil baucap lawan adingnya nang bangaran Habil, “Ayo kita masuk ka kabun.” <<Maka inya wan Habil masuk ka kabun.>> Wayah bubuhannya baada di kabun nang itu, inya manyarang adingnya. Lalu ading Kabil dimati'inya.

Genesis 4:9 Then the LORD asked Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” Cain answered the LORD, “I don't know. Must I always take care of my brother?”
Genesis 4:9 Lalu Allah batakun lawan Kabil, “Di mana garang ading ikam nang bangaran Habil?” Kabil manyahut lawan Allah, “Aku kada tahu. Bujuranlah aku tatarusan maharagu adingku?”

Genesis 4:10 Then the LORD said, “What did you do? Listen! Your brother's blood is in the ground. It's crying out to me.
Genesis 4:10 Lalu Allah baucap, “Napa nang ikam lakuakan? Coba dangar! Darah ading ikam baada di dalam tanah. Itu bahimat lagi badoa lawan Aku.

Genesis 4:11 Therefore, I curse you. You won't be able to harvest crops from the ground. Your brother's blood is in the ground because you killed him.
Genesis 4:11 Maka Aku mangutuk ikam. Ikam kada cagar bisa mangatam jalai tanah. Darah ading ikam baada di dalam tanah lantaran ikam mamati'inya.

Genesis 4:12 When you plant seeds, they won't grow from the ground for you. You'll wander on the earth continuously.”

Genesis 4:13 Then Cain said to the LORD, “You're punishing me too much! I won't be able to live!
Genesis 4:13 Lalu Kabil baucap lawan Allah, “Pian lagi mahukum aku lawan hukuman nang barat! Aku kada cagar bisa hidup!

Genesis 4:14 Today you're forcing me to stop working in the fields. And I have to hide from you now. I'll wander on the earth. And if a person finds me, he'll kill me.”
Genesis 4:14 Hari ini Pian lagi mamaksa aku ampih bagawi di kabun. Lalu wayahini aku musti basambunyi matan Pian. Aku handak bapindah-pindah di atas bumi. Lalu amun urang manamuakan aku, ada bubuhannya mamati'i aku.”

Genesis 4:15 But the LORD said to Cain, “No. If a person kills you, I'll punish him severely. <<I'll punish that person more than I punished you!>> I'll punish that person seven times.” Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that other people who saw him wouldn't kill him.
Genesis 4:15 Tagal Allah baucap lawan Kabil, “Kada pang. Amun urang mamati'i ikam, Aku mahukumnya lawan hukuman nang barat. <<Aku labih mamahukumi urang nang itu daripada Aku mangamahukumi ikam!>> Aku handak mahukum urang nang itu tujuh kali.” Lalu Inya mambuati ciri di atas Kabil sakira urang-urang nang lain nang malihatnya kada hakun mamati'inya.
